# Introduction/Business Problem
In the city of Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic). Stakeholders would like to start a new business. 
A brand new *Taxi service* of fast electric cars within the city. The idea is to have a set of Taxi stations.
The problem is to find the most efficient places with the following criterias:

1. Closest to the most popular and high density places where people would most often order a taxi service such as:
  1.1. Restaurants
  1.2. Hotels
  1.3. Clubs (sport/night) etc
  1.4. Hospitals
2. Only within the Bishkek city
3. Overall not more than 5 stations

Those stations should be visualized and shown on the map

P.S: It's a capstone project so those spots aren't necessary have to be eligible or having enough physical space.
The goal is to cluster those data and find those efficient spots
