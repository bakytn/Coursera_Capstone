# Introduction/Business Problem
In the city of Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic). Stakeholders would like to start a new business. 
A brand new *Taxi service* of fast electric cars within the city. The idea is to have a set of Taxi stations.
The problem is to find the most efficient places with the following criterias:

1. Closest to the most popular and high density places where people would most often order a taxi service such as:

   1.1.  Restaurants
   1.2.  Hotels
   1.3.  Clubs (sport/night) etc
   1.4.  Hospitals
   
2. Only within the Bishkek city
3. Overall not more than 5 stations

Those stations should be visualized and shown on the map. 

# Importance
Stations will have superchargers for cars. That's why it's important to find perfect spots for them.

# Target audience
Apparently the target audience are all people who are leaving those places (see above), tourists but not limited to. The Taxi service is going to be used by everyone. The goal is to provide fastest service

P.S: It's a capstone project so those spots aren't necessary have to be eligible or having enough physical space.
The goal is to cluster those data and find those efficient spots
